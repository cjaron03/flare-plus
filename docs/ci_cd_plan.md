# CI/CD Pipeline Sketch

## Goals
- Automate quality gates before merging (linting, unit tests, model checks).
- Package reproducible artifacts (containers, model binaries) on promoted builds.
- Monitor data and model health via scheduled validations.

## Trigger Matrix
- **Pull Request:** fast feedback (â‰¤10 min) targeting feature branches.
- **Main Branch Merge:** full regression checks plus packaging.
- **Scheduled (Nightly):** data ingestion + drift audits; optional weekly retraining.

## Pipeline Stages
1. **Lint & Static Analysis**
   - Run `ruff`/`flake8`, mypy (if typing), and formatting checks.
   - Fail fast; share artifacts and annotations inline on PR.
2. **Unit & Component Tests**
   - Execute pytest suite with mocked NOAA responses.
   - Enforce coverage threshold (e.g., 80%) and publish report.
3. **Integration & Data Contracts**
   - Smoke-test data ingestion against sandbox NOAA endpoints or recorded fixtures.
   - Validate schema contracts and feature availability.
4. **Model Evaluation Safeguards**
   - Run quick evaluation on holdout dataset; compare against saved baseline metrics.
   - Gate merges if performance regresses beyond tolerances.
5. **Artifact Build & Publish**
   - Build Docker image (API + UI + inference) with tagged version.
   - Store model artifacts in registry (e.g., S3/MLflow) with metadata.

## Nightly Validation Flow
- Trigger workflow via scheduler (cron).
- Refresh recent NOAA data; log failures with alerting (pager/email).
- Compute data drift statistics and feature-health dashboards.
- Run extended integration tests and longer horizon model scoring.
- Optionally enqueue retraining job; promote new model after manual review.

## Operational Considerations
- Manage secrets via GitHub Actions OIDC or repo secrets.
- Cache dependencies (pip/conda) to keep runtimes low.
- Surface key metrics (test coverage, drift alerts) in README badge or dashboard.
- Document manual rollback procedure for faulty deployments.
