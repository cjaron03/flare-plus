    <h2>Scenario exploration (coming soon)</h2>
    <p>
      Scenario analysis requires recomputing engineered features when you modify region metrics. The Python pipelines are
      being prepared for this workflow; until then, use the Predictions tab to change timestamps or regions manually.
    </p>

    <h3>Planned capabilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interactively adjust McIntosh / Mount Wilson classes, magnetic complexity, and flux trends</li>
      <li>Compare baseline vs scenario probability deltas with visual overlays</li>
      <li>Generate playbooks that capture the modified inputs, predictions, and notes</li>
      <li>Export scenario runs for backtesting or sharing in ops reviews</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interim workflow</h3>
    <p>
      Choose representative timestamps and region numbers in the Predictions tab, run both models, and capture the
      resulting probabilities plus survival buckets. Combine those snapshots with NOAA context to emulate the scenario
      analysis.
